# mmt

## Overview

Checkout created using React/Vite. Each individual item can have its quantity changed by user input and the price will update dynamically for that item.
This also causes the total price of all items to update. The clear button resets all quantity values to 0.
There is a currency exchange dropdown selection in the top left of the screen. Choosing a different currency will convert the amount and change the symbol
corresponding to the currency selected.

The next step for this for me would be to add a dark theme slider.
